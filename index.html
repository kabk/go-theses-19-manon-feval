					How we<br>percieve<br>darkness
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					Have you ever tried to go and find the darkest night? The one where you can stare into a sky so full of stars that you can’t even see a single constellation anymore? If you haven’t yet, let me tell you that in order to find it, you’ll have to go as far as you possibly can from any city light. Actually, artificial lighting has become so present in our daily life, that darkness has almost become a luxury. But while the topic of light pollution and dark skies preservation is starting to be more talked of, unpolluted dark skies are seen as something “out there”, outside of human activities which, as you probably know, seem to be defined by artificial light. But why is it that urban darkness is seen as dangerous or creepy while natural darkness is seen as beautiful and mysterious? Why am I afraid to walk alone in a park at night while at the same time I am purposely walking away from the bunfire to enjoy the quietness of the sleeping forest we are camping in? In this thesis I will explore the relation and duality between the urban space and the wild space, the artificial and the natural, all within the topic of light and dark. Why do they have to stay separate entities? I will first try to understand the fear and nervousness surrounding urban darkness. The nyctophobia of western cities. I will dive into the history of illumination through medieval and modern cities. How is it that urban darkness has become a space which seems to be synonymous of illegal or marginalised activities? And how did the ‘24 hour’ city help emphasise, hide or divide?

					“Darkness symbolised the decadence that had to be overcome in order to create a city of responsible, autonomous, rationally oriented, liberal citizens.”<br/>(Extract from “Gloomy Cities” by Tim Edensor)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					I will then look at the astronomical sublime and how darkness is perceived in the natural or wild environnement. Humanity has been inspired by starry skies all over its history so could we argue that the loss of the night sky is not dramatic only to the ecosystem but is also a real cultural loss? The wonder and the beauty the dark sky have inspired artists, astrologists, sailors, myths, storytellers of all times. The “International Dark-Sky Association” actually makes the protection and preservation of night skies a “moral duty” for the present and future generations.  
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					“ A starry sky is beautiful and inspires a sense of wonder, yet there is also an immensity and vastness that inspires a sense of awe. (...) It has temporal and spatial dimensions that we can comprehend abstractly, but its scale is difficult to fully grasp. Put more simply, it is the epitome of the mathematical sublime in nature.” (Extract from Re-envisioning the Nocturnal Sublime” by Taylor Stone)

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					I would like then to show why placing the night sky as something which belongs outside of the cities, in nature, is actually reinforcing the dangerous dualism that sets humans outside of nature. As William Cronon said: “By imagining that our true nature is wilderness, we forgive ourselves the homes we actually inhabit”. In that sense, the restoration of urban dark skies should be definitely taken into account when designing the urban nightscape. 
					
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					I will argue that the urban and the natural can and should coexist not only when it comes to “the greener cities” but also when it comes to “darker cities”. We will see how designers - such as The firm Concepto (introducing “dark zones” into the city core of Rennes, France) are thinking of new ways to implement light in cities, and how artists - such as Thierry Cohen (with his serie “darkened cities”) are helping bring awareness towards the issue of light pollution and the perception of darkness. Because although design solutions need to be found, making cities darker also implies that western society puts a break to its nyctophobia and start perceiving urban darkness differently.

					II. Urban<br>  Darkness:
				</h2>
				<h3>
					a little<br> bit of<br> history
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				
				<p class="paragraph">
					In medieval times, christian religion ruled over the western society and darkness was a common metaphor and symbol of the royaume of Satan. It was seen as the representation of the evil, sin, death. In darkness lured all the bad creatures, monsters, witches, ghosts and bad spirits. In medieval and early modern times those negative association to darkness are very present and fill the nocturnal experience of the religious and the believers. But not only the superstitious feared the dark. Without illumination it was adventurous to wonder outside your home in the pitch-dark night of the early cities. Many were the obstacles in the badly lit alleys: branches, trees, garbage, piles of rubbish, holes. The shadows also gave protection to the badly intentionate, and could hide the criminals, bandits, thieves or murderers. In the dangerous dark street an enemy could easily be mistaken for a friend so finding the right path deprived of sight was challenging for the brave souls that dared to wonder out during night time. These more concrete experiences in the physical world reinforced the prevalent nyctophobia which was already well fed by the imagination of the population. Yet even if those times seem far away, the negative associations linked to darkness  are slow to disappear. As Tim Edensor explains: “Metaphors have persistently been used to identify darkness with negative understanding of spaces and times and they continue to linger in the western mentality and language with terms such as: “Dark forces”, “dark ages”, “dark side”, “dark tourism”, “dark continent” and many more”. Blackouts for instance are reported as calamity or crises when it is spoke of in the news. Actually the absence of light, for many, is synonymous with poverty, war-time, deprivation and so the symbolic value of light as something saving us from dark times becomes really powerful. 

				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, and it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.” (3rd Verse, Genesis)
				</p>

				<p class="paragraph">
					By the end of the 17th century the urban centers of Amsterdam, Paris, Turin, London and Hambourg were lit by reliable sources of street light. With these new coming technologies, night time became an extended time and space for social activities, new form of consumptions as well as giving cities a new reputation as more shops, cafés, bars, theater started to emerge in city centers. As we were able to push back the frontiers of darkness thanks to artificial lighting technologies, we opened up the night to all new perspectives. Of course it did not happen all in a day. The process was slow. The electric bulb for instance only appeared in the 1880s. Before that technologies for street lighting were diverse and different for instance between the rich and the poor. (is it necessary to give more detail lines about the type of fuels that were used then?) Nevertheless, in what Foucault calls “the enlightenment era”, rather than staying home fearful of the dark, citizens of the early modern cities start going outside to enjoy the new possibilities and experiences that offered the lit night. The now transformed illuminated urban nightscape has earned the name “24 hour city”.	
 
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					“from dark to light signified the passage from medieval ignorance to rational thought and science, a process that would “shed light on all things” in the pursuit of “truth, purity, revelation and knowledge, embodying the ideals of “illumination, objectivity and wisdom”. (Tim Edensor, Gloomy cities)
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					But just as the street light made nightlife more accessible, comfortable and easier for the habitants of the city, it also facilitated surveillance, promoting a safer space for the population. 	
 
				</p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					Spaces don’t have the same meaning by day than they do by night and governments start developing techniques to keep some sort of order and control in the urban night time. According to Robert Williams in “Darkness, Deterritorialization, and social control” there are three strategies that are used to reorder the space of the urban darkness: channeling, marginalisation and exclusion.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					The first one, channeling, is the use of illumination and advertising to direct our intention towards something in particular and intend to make certain spaces more favorable places to be at night. There is a typical hierarchy in how cities are lit at night. For instance the city center and big shopping street will be more illuminated than side streets. When you really think about it, the use of light at night gave the possibility to extend our time of consumption from day time to much later in the night. And so even after closing time, the use of brighter and more vivid lights are used to accentuate our desire towards shops or places of entertainment even past the darkest hour. Businesses alway remind us that they are here and their products ready to be bought with colorful windows and advertising. We can observe a similar difference between the roads such as main arteries with a high traffic density in comparison to the other ones. The less important or centered a street seems to be, the less enlightened it is. And as much as we can accentuate with light, we can also keep things hidden without it. Often, in the nightscape, some buildings or architectural pride will be lit all night long as icons representative of the city, while the less beautiful neighbourhood or buildings are kept in the dark in order to keep them less visible. In a way lighting at night can shape a whole unique landscape and governments have the power to decide how it should look like. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					As I mentioned earlier, even though the use of street light makes it favorable for us to travel from one place to another, most of all they allow surveillance and gives us a feeling of security for our own persona and properties. Marginalisation, the second strategy, in my opinion, is only applicable because of our long lasting nyctophobia. Its primal effect is to basically classify certain group of people as inferior or dangerous and geographically separate them from the socially “higher groups”. In our cities nowadays, as mentions Robert Williams, we can observe two main types of marginalisation techniques which he calls official zoning laws and informal social codes. Zoning laws, he explains, are conscious decisions by local government to organise space within a city. They try to do so by prohibiting certain shops or commerce to open up in certain areas or in re-organising city center to attract tourists, and wealthy professionals townsfolk. In consequence it forces people with lower budget to retract further out of cities where places are more affordable. The second technique applied, informal social codes, happens through preconceived ideas and classification of people by race, gender, religion, ethnicity and many more. Discrimination obviously occurs as well during day time hours but certain neighbourhood or places will become off limit past the dark hours. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					The last technique called the modality of exclusion is in some ways similar to the modality of marginalisation but its objective is to really create a clear separation between  two spaces with walls, barriers etc. For instance in some pre-modern cities their gates were closed past a certain time of the day to protect from intruders and external threats. Nowadays you still can observe buildings or private houses surrounded by walls or floodlight with guardians to prevent outsiders to walk in. The flood lights enable you to easily see people coming or leaving past it. Its used in prisons for example but is also a common technique of surveillance used in the urban space. Often you will also find residential building which are open during the day but will then be closed during the night. To enter past its closing time it requires a key card, password and so on. Public space such as a parc can also be closed past dusk hour to keep a certain social control and keep the population safe. Another great example of exclusion is the bouncer. You might not see it that way nevertheless, he keeps you from entering a club in order to preserve a type of exclusivity for the party. Even though we could argue that they somehow keep us safe, these techniques are used to shape and order the urban night space but they create zones of social exclusiveness which we should be aware of. 
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					 “Because of its transgressive meanings and societally harmful uses, darkness threatens to deterritorialize the rationalizing order of society. Darkness serves to deterritorialize society when it obscures, obstructs, or otherwise hinders the deployment of the strategies, techniques, and technologies that enforce the rationalizing order of society, thereby allowing potentially transgressive behaviors to occur under a veil of anonymity.” (Extract of “Darkness, Deterritorialization, and social control” by Robert Williams)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					The darkness of the urban space has always be seen and used as a space for transgression. It allowed for secret meeting during time of war and rebellion, opened up spaces in which people could explore all sort of fantasies and experiences hidden from the judgement of society. Darkness allowed for subcultures to develop and question the norms. It created a space in which marginalized groups could openly talk, dream, hope etc. Graffitis, to me, are a powerful example of expression which is taking place in the hidden anonymity of the dark cities. As Robert William says: “Being socially marginalised is not synonymous with being intellectually disconnected”. The darkness of the city has always been feared but it also allows for a certain type of resistance towards the oppression of society. Because of that, the opinion of the population towards the urban darkness may differ. Some want the security of a closed gate while others may argue that the public space should be equally accessible to all people. But no matter what the discourse is, the idea that the darkness is unsafe for those wondering in the city alone seems to stay prominent in the mind of the population. Wether this is true or a simple social construct reinforced by governments in order to better control the space still needs to be questioned and discussed further.

					The<br>negative<br>effects of<br>artificial<br>lights

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					We might not really realise it, but in our modern world, the night seems to be at the edge of extinction. Of course the sun will keep setting every evening, and it will leave space to the moon, the stars and a dark blue sky at night. But when was the last time you were able to actually see those stars? How far out of the city did you have to go in order to do so? Only a few places are left on the planet where the real darkness of the night has been left unspoiled, and only there, will you be able to see the magnitude of a real night sky. And believe me, when you look at thousands of stars, there are so many that you can no longer see constellations. Doesn’t it sound unreal? - “Well but why does it matter, you may ask, I don’t care about being able to see the stars. Light pollution is only a problem for astronomers!”. That’s not quite true. Well, of course, astronomers have more difficulty studying the sky. Many observatories have been left abandoned because of light pollution. But the constant emission of light during night time coming from cities, rural areas, highways etc has also been disrupting the ecosystems at night. Many animals are dependent on the balance between day and night in order to survive. And what we call “the city glow” has a huge impact on the life of nocturnal animals. In the last hundred years, we have been turning night into day. And other species have had no time to adapt. 1 billion birds are killed each year as a direct consequence of light pollution. In florida, Sea turtles Hatchlings find the sea by detecting the bright horizon over the ocean. Artificial lights draw them away from the ocean and millions of hatchlings are killed this way every year. 
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					“Plants and animals depend on Earth’s daily cycle of light and dark rhythm to govern life-sustaining behaviors such as reproduction, nourishment, sleep and protection from predators. Scientific evidence suggests that artificial light at night has negative and deadly effects on many creatures including amphibians, birds, mammals, insects and plants.” (extract from website of the International Dark Sky Association, IDA)

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					But it’s not only the birds or the turtles. Fish, reptiles, insects, trees, plants, and even we are affected by the light pollution. Indeed, humans have also evolved to the rhythms of day and night and recent studies show that very few of us can experience true dark nights anymore. This might have a negative effects on our health which can increase risks for obesity, depression, sleep disorders, diabetes, and many more problems. The effect of the light pollution is way greater than we actually realise and they have become a real concern of the environmentalists and advocacy groups such as the International Dark sky Associations. But rather than talking about how many billions of euros are spent each year in the lighting of our cities, or how impactful this is over our health, it seems that the main argument that is used to reach out to the population is the loss of our starry sky and the loss of the beautiful and cultural heritage the mysterious dark night brings.

				<p class="quote fixed">
					“Like most life on Earth, humans adhere to a circadian rhythm a sleep-wake pattern governed by the day-night cycle. Artificial light at night can disrupt that cycle. Our bodies produce the hormone melatonin in response to circadian rhythm. Melatonin helps keep us healthy. It has antioxidant properties, induces sleep, boosts the immune system, lowers cholesterol, and helps the functioning of the thyroid, pancreas, ovaries, testes and adrenal glands. Nighttime exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin production.” (extract from website of the International Dark Sky Association, IDA)

					“In early eras, the power of the stars inspired tales of ancestors, their quest for food, the animals we lived with, and the delicate balance needed to maintain life. The stars taught us the way to leave with each other and our environment. As our civilisation grew, the stars provided the basis for binding together hundreds, thousands, and now millions of us in commerce, in religion, in science and also in war.” (Extract of “The Power of Stars” by Bryan E. Penprase)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					All over human history among different culture and population, people have always looked at the sky. The dark sky filled with stars had people wondered since the most ancient times. Our ancestors started to recognise patterns and drawings in the stars, and each culture made up their own scheme to organise them and understand their movement. The stars are not simply far points of light but also tools that have been shared in all history. They have helped men find their way and follow directions, our calendars among civilisations have always been based on them, they have inspired myths and tales as much as they have represented deep values through civilizations. 
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					“After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.” (Extract of Holy Bible, New International Version)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					When we look at the stars today, we probably have a comparable experience to the ones our ancestors did. We are staring at the same sky. It unconsciously brings a moving feeling to recognise emotions that have been shared through all generations. The transcendent view of a clear starry sky can move even the most rational city dweller. The stars brings us together as a species sharing the same planet, looking at the same sky. They make us feel small, or rather they make us realise how infinite the universe is. It is interesting to see how our perception of darkness within this particular context gives it a completely different meaning. It is not anymore a subject of fear or transgression but rather something beautiful, vast and mysterious. As much as we try to free the cities from darkness, in the wild, it has become our moral duty to preserve it so that people can enjoy the transcending experience of staring into a clear dark sky.

					“if the milky way is mediocre, then billions of other galaxies must be very much like the Milky Way, just as one city suburb looks much the same as another city suburb, with numbers in this range, perhaps we aren’t so distinctive! But then, again, is distinctiveness, uniqueness the really important thing? Isn’t wonderment still in place at the thought of an unplanned, unintended transition from non-life to life, the impersonal to the personal, quite irrespectively of how often it happens in the universe?” (Extract of “The Aesthetics of Sky and Space” by Ronald W. Hepburn)
				</p>	
				
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p class="paragraph">
					 Many sites and parks have promoted their natural darkness at night for scientific and educational purposes but also for tourist and leisure activities. City folks are travelling to these remote areas, away from the glare of artificial illumination in order to reconnect with nature and look at the millions of stars that are each night hidden behind the red vale of urban light. The poster serie “Milky Way” by Tyler Nordgren is a good depiction of this promotion. In his posters are represented various national parks of the united states at night time. The images are in various shades of blue and give a quite a peaceful representation of the natural darkness. Two characters are always standing in the picture, in full admiration of the immensity of the starry sky. The slogan say: “See the Milky-Way in…”. The artist represents exactly the astronomical sublime dark sky activists are trying to promote and protect. But isn’t this type of promotion actually emphasising the divide between the natural and the urban? Same division that seems to exist between the darkness in the natural context and the urban context?
